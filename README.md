# Entity Project
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.6.1.

This repository contains the source code for a Roblox project, developed using a Rojo-like workflow. The project is structured with a `src` directory that maps to various services within the Roblox game environment.

## Key Systems

### 1. Inventory System

The inventory system is a core feature, designed with a robust client-server model.

-   **Server-Side**:
    -   `src/ServerScriptService/Handlers/DataStatsInventoryServer.server.luau`: Manages player data persistence (loading/saving) and handles inventory-related remote calls.
    -   `src/ServerScriptService/ServerModules/PlayerInv.luau`: Contains the core inventory logic, such as moving, adding, and stacking items. It defines the structure of the player's inventory (`Main`, `Armor`, `Offhand`, `Hotbar`).
-   **Client-Side**:
    -   `src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/UI/Inv/ClientInit.client.luau`: Initializes the inventory on the client.
    -   `src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/UI/Inv/ItemInputController.luau`: Manages all user input for the inventory, such as clicking and dragging items.
    -   `src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/UI/InvUI/InvManager.luau`: Handles the visual representation of the inventory.
-   **Shared**:
    -   `src/ReplicatedStorage/Modules/ItemDesc.luau`: A shared module containing descriptions and properties of all items (e.g., stackability, type).

### 2. Bow and Arrow System

The project features a complete bow and arrow combat system.

-   **Core Logic**:
    -   `src/ReplicatedStorage/Modules/BowManager.luau`: A shared module for managing the bow's state.
    -   `src/ServerScriptService/Scripts/BowHandler.server.luau`: Handles server-side logic like damage calculation.
-   **Client-Side**:
    -   `src/ReplicatedStorage/Assets/Items/Bow/`: Contains various client-side scripts for managing animations (`BowArmsManager.client.luau`, `FPVAnimationControl.luau`), UI (`BowUIManager.luau`), and local behavior (`BowManagerLocal.client.luau`).
-   **Projectile System**:
    -   `src/ReplicatedStorage/Modules/FastCastRedux/`: This popular module is used for reliable and high-performance projectile physics and hit detection for the arrows.

### 3. Data Management

Player data is managed using `ProfileService`, a robust solution for handling data in Roblox.

-   `src/ServerScriptService/ServerModules/ProfileStore.luau`: A wrapper for `ProfileService` to simplify data loading and saving.
-   `DataStatsInventoryServer.server.luau` implements `ProfileService` to manage player sessions and persist inventory and other stats.

## Important Notes for Developers

### Client-Server Communication

-   The primary method of communication is through `RemoteFunction` and `RemoteEvent` objects located in `ReplicatedStorage/Remotes`.
-   The main remote for inventory actions is `InvokeInventoryAction`. The client invokes this function with an action name (e.g., `RequestMoveItem`) and parameters. The server then processes the request.
-   Server-to-server communication is handled using `BindableFunction` and `BindableEvent` objects, primarily for decoupling the data management script from other server-side game logic.

### Tool Equipping System

-   The tool equipping system uses `BindableEvent` objects within the `Tool` itself (under an `Events` folder).
-   When a player equips a tool from the hotbar, the `ItemInputController` script asks the server to place the tool in the player's `Backpack`.
-   Then, it fires the `Equip` bindable event within the tool to trigger the tool's specific equipping logic (e.g., animations, UI changes).

### Dropping Items

-   Dropping items is handled by the `DropItem` remote function.
-   The `ItemInputController` script ensures that if an item is currently equipped, it is unequipped before being dropped to prevent any issues.

### Inventory Structure

The inventory has 4 distinct sections:
-   **Main**: 24 slots for general item storage
-   **Armor**: 4 slots for armor pieces
-   **Offhand**: 1 slot for offhand items
-   **Hotbar**: 8 slots for quick-access items
